# Bython
Python with Braces (and constants)

In command prompt, type 'bython -h' 

# Bugs: 
	Type annotations in contexts on variables
	Type annotations on constants 

# Warning: 
	The usage of {} to declare an empty dictionary does not work and has been replaced with the empty code block for scopes 
	Constants should be declared in the global scope and imported to local scopes for proper use 
	Place lambda expressions inside parenthases 
	Place commas after single-elements sets and dictionaries (like creating single-element tuples)
